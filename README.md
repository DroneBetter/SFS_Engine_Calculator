# SFS_Engine_Calculator
A Python command line tool to tell you the best combination of engines for every stage of a given rocket in the game Spaceflight Simulator.
# Not yet functional or close to being such
Being worked on (hopefully still will be when you read this).
# TODO
Make constants calculation work, make documentation (explain what every function and variable does, possibly disambiguate variable names in the process), clean up earlier functions (ie. findCombinations()) and make the evaluation logic and output display, eventually make many functions use return() to be cleaner and use fewer lists, make the combination{StatisticName} and stageCombination{StatisticName} lists into combinationStatistics[NameID] to reduce clutter (so all of the 'global {list}' '{list} = {value}' lines (18 so far) only have to be one).
