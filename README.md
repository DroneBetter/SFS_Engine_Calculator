# SFS_Engine_Calculator
A Python command line tool to tell you the best combination of engines for every stage of a given rocket in the game Spaceflight Simulator.
# TODO
Make constants calculation work, make documentation (explain what every function does), clean up earlier functions (ie. findCombinations()) and make the evaluation logic and output display, eventually make many functions use return() to be cleaner and use fewer lists.
